| Component | Version | License | How it is used |

## FFmpeg source (LGPL)

The Steam Frame build links FFmpeg statically. The exact source is FFmpeg
8.1.3 from https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-8.1.3.tar.xz plus the patches in
`third_party/ffmpeg-patches/`, configured and built by
`scripts/build-frame-media.sh`. That script also rebuilds the libraries, so you
can relink VRedze against a modified FFmpeg with `scripts/build-frame.sh`.

## Codec patents

These licenses cover copyright only. Some video and audio formats (for example
H.264, HEVC, E-AC-3 and DTS) are covered by patents in some countries, and
decoding them may require patent licenses. This project gives no patent grant.
